#### Bash Scripting : Get Started 

What is Bash Scripting?
    Bash scripting involves writing a sequence of commands in a file to automate tasks. Scripts are executed by the Bash shell, which interprets the commands.

Steps to Get Started

    Step 1: Create a Script:
            We can use VS code and simple text editor
            file rename as script.sh
    step 2: Write Basic Commands:
            Start the script with a shebang (#!/bin/bash), indicating it's a Bash script.
            #!/bin/bash
            echo "Hello, World!"

    Step3: Make the Script Executable:
            Run: chmod +x script.sh
    Step 4: Execute the Script:
            ./script.sh


##### Variable

a> system defined

if variale is capital letter then are system defined most likely e.g.
    echo $BASH
    echo $PWD

b> user deifine
    name=Vipul 
    echo $name ( Vipul wil print)


# Accept the aruguments
 read 
 $echo $REPLY
 
 read name
 $echo name 

 read -p "Enter name :" name
 $echo name 

 read -sp "Enter Password :" pass
 $echo pass 

 read -a names
 echo "${arr[$i]}"

    

## List of all comparsion integer in bash shell

# Variables
a=10
b=20

# Equal to
if [ "$a" -eq "$b" ]; then
    echo "a equals b"
else
    echo "a does not equal b"
fi

# Not equal to
if [ "$a" -ne "$b" ]; then
    echo "a is not equal to b"
fi

# Greater than
if [ "$a" -gt "$b" ]; then
    echo "a is greater than b"
else
    echo "a is not greater than b"
fi

# Less than
if [ "$a" -lt "$b" ]; then
    echo "a is less than b"
fi

# Greater than or equal to
if [ "$a" -ge "$b" ]; then
    echo "a is greater than or equal to b"
fi

# Less than or equal to
if [ "$a" -le "$b" ]; then
    echo "a is less than or equal to b"
fi

# can be use like this 

if (($var1<=$var2)); then 
echo "var 1 is less than equal to var2"
fi
