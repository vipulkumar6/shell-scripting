#### Bash Scripting : Get Started 

What is Bash Scripting?
    Bash scripting involves writing a sequence of commands in a file to automate tasks. Scripts are executed by the Bash shell, which interprets the commands.

Steps to Get Started

    Step 1: Create a Script:
            We can use VS code and simple text editor
            file rename as script.sh
    step 2: Write Basic Commands:
            Start the script with a shebang (#!/bin/bash), indicating it's a Bash script.
            #!/bin/bash
            echo "Hello, World!"

    Step3: Make the Script Executable:
            Run: chmod +x script.sh
    Step 4: Execute the Script:
            ./script.sh
